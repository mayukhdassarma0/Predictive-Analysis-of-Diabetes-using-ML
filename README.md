# Predictive-Analysis-of-Diabetes-using-ML
In this project, I tackled diabetes prediction using the PIMA dataset. I handled the data cleaning and feature engineering before pitting classifiers against each other. By prioritizing ROC-AUC over simple accuracy, I found a model that’s actually reliable for real-world use.
Libraries used:-
1)Numpy
2)Pandas
3)Matplotlib
