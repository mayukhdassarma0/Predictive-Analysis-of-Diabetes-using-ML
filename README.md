# Predictive-Analysis-of-Diabetes-using-ML
This project is all about predicting diabetes using the well-known PIMA Indians Diabetes Dataset. The aim? To create a reliable machine learning model that can identify diabetes at an early stage. It utilizes important medical metrics such as glucose levels, blood pressure, BMI, insulin levels, age, and the number of pregnancies. I kicked things off by loading the data and diving into exploratory analysis—looking at distributions, finding missing values, and figuring out correlations.
Then it was time for data cleaning. I replaced those strange zero values that didn’t really make sense and standardized the features so that the models could compete fairly. After that, I applied a bunch of classifiers—starting with Logistic Regression for the simpler cases, then moving on to Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting to tackle the more complex patterns. Since the dataset is imbalanced (with a lot more non-diabetics), I focused heavily on ROC-AUC scores instead of just plain accuracy, also using confusion matrices and ROC curves for a comprehensive view. I even plotted those curves to illustrate how well the ensemble models performed, especially in capturing those nonlinear relationships.
I did everything in Python, using the usual tools: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn. It's a complete pipeline, taking messy data all the way to evaluation—great for anyone getting started with healthcare machine learning, including smart metrics and model comparisons.
